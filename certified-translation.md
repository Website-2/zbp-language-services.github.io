<h5><a id="market_research_interpreting">Certified translation and interpreting</a></h5>
<br>
Do you have a document that needs translating, even if it's urgent?
Do you need an interpreter for your wedding registration appointment or ceremony?
Are you looking for someone to accompany you to an appointment at a registration office in Berlin to help with your German? 
<br>
Just send me an email or give me a call and tell me what you need. I'd be happy to help!
<br><br>
* Languages I can help with: German to English, English to German
* How I can help for translations: personal documents for wedding ceremonies, visa and passport applications, etc., even if it's urgent
* How I can help for interpreting: whether you need someone for your visit to the registry office for your wedding, you're organising an entirely bilingual wedding day, or you need someone for a general appointment at a registration office, just let me know and I can help with the interpreting and organisation
