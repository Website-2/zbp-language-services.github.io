<br>
Do you have a document that needs translating – and maybe it's urgent?<br><br>
Do you need an interpreter for your wedding registration appointment or ceremony?<br><br>
Are you looking for someone to accompany you to an appointment at a registration office in Berlin to help with your German? 
<br><br>
In addition to my main area of work, market research interpreting and transcription, I also help individuals and businesses requiring certified translation and interpreting. Just send me an email at <a href="mailto:z-c@live.co.uk">&nbsp;z-c@live.co.uk</a> or give me a call under <a href="tel:004917676298153">&nbsp;+49 176 76298153</a> and tell me what you need. I'd be happy to help!

* How I can help with translation: personal documents for wedding ceremonies, visa and passport applications, etc., even if it's urgent
* How I can help with interpreting: whether you need someone for your visit to the registry office for your wedding, you're organising an entirely bilingual wedding day, or you need someone for a general appointment at a registration office, just let me know and I can help with the interpreting and organisation
