{% include figure.html image="/assets/Profile.png" position="right" width="200" height="200" %}
* State-examined translator and interpreter
* Court accredited as a translator and interpreter
* 8 years of experience in the language industry
* Regular professional development to ensure up-to-date knowledge of industry trends and best practices
* In-depth cultural knowledge thanks to growing up bilingual in the UK, extensive travelling, and having lived abroad
<br><br><br>
A culture and nature-focused traveller, I grew up bilingual in the UK and spent long periods in Germany and also Spain. If you're wondering whether my childhood resulted in a big interest in languages and culture, you're right. Off of the back of that interest, I have spent the last 10 years deepening my understanding of the cultural differences between the UK, Germany and Spain, meaning the language services I provide fully consider the cultural nuances that exist.
<br><br>
Following 10 years of success as a service provider in a different industry, I founded ZBP Language Services in 2017, so that I could apply the knowledge, skills and qualifications I had gained during that time to international projects and align my work with my interests.
<br><br>
In the 8 years that I have now been working in the language industry, I've provided support on projects sponsored by Fortune 500 companies and other market leaders in the consumer and medical industries. According to feedback, my language services help product teams to quickly and efficiently gain the insights they need to develop their product or campaign.
